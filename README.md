# Ft_printf ->Replicate the original printf<-
**Ft_printf** is a 42 schools project that involves recreating the original **printf** function from stdio.h. The goal of the project is to delve into hadling variable arguments, work with different output formats, and gain a better undestanding of **printf**.

- Handling variable arguments with **va_list**.
- Conversion of integers to different numeric bases like: decimal, hexadecimal, etc.
- Implementation of memory pointer printing.
